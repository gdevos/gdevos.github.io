## Gerard's notes

### Google Cloud Architect study notes

These are the notes I took while studying for the Google Cloud Architect cert. 
I have some experience with GCP as well as AWS and Apache CloudStack so some basic stuff might not be in here.

Start at https://cloud.google.com/certification/cloud-architect

It lists the following goals:
> - Design and plan a cloud solution architecture
> - Manage and provision the cloud solution infrastructure
> - Design for security and compliance
> - Analyze and optimize technical and business processes
> - Manage implementations of cloud architecture
> - Ensure solution and operations reliability

There are only two example questions at https://cloud.google.com/certification/sample#0 so that will not help much.

The exam guide is much more compete: https://cloud.google.com/certification/guides/cloud-architect/
